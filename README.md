## General Info

This is is a beehive monitor that allows you to see the temperature and humidity of the hive. It also shows the general health of the hive using an LED strip based on ideal temperature and humidity values.

There are two temperature probes, one at the top of the hive and one that can be placed down by the hive ball to get a more accurate reading of the bees themselves. The temperature sensor at the top of the hive is also responsible for measuring humidity.

Sensor data is gathered once a minute, additionally, a rolling thirty-minute average is generated based on this data.
